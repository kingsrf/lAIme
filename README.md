# lAIme: learn AI more effectively, Made Easy for Seniors

**LAIme** is a simple, user-friendly platform that helps seniors understand artificial intelligence in an easy and accessible way.

This project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience where users can engage with AI by clicking buttons and receiving simple responses.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Frontend built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.
- When users click on "WRITE ME" or "CALL ME", they interact with a dynamic AI response area.
- (Optionally) The backend can be extended to call the Gemini AI API using Node.js and the Google Generative AI SDK.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- (Optional) Node.js + Google Generative AI

## ðŸ“ˆ Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

- **Speed (Time)**: How long the code takes to run mainly depends on how fast Google's AI service responds and the speed of the internet connection.

### Space Complexity

- **Memory Usage (Space)**: 
  - Memory is used for storing the user's question (userRequest) and the AI's generated answer (text).
  - If the question or the answer is longer, it will naturally use a bit more memory.
  
- **Technical Estimate**:  
  Space Complexity â‰ˆ **O(N + M)**  
  Where:
  - **N** = length of the input prompt
  - **M** = length of the output text generated by the AI
